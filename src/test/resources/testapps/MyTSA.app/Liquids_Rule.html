        <h1>LIQUID RULE</h1>
                        
        <p>You are allowed to bring a quart-sized bag of liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes in your carry-on bag and through the checkpoint. These are limited to travel-sized containers that are 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item. Placing these items in the small bag and separating from your carry-on baggage facilitates the screening process. Pack items that are in containers larger than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters in checked baggage.</p>
        <p>Any liquid, aerosol, gel, cream or paste that alarms during screening will require additional screening.</p>
