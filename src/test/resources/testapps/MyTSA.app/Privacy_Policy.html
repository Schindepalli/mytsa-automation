        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE MYTSA MOBILE APPLICATIONS (IOS AND ANDROID)</h1>
        
        <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
          <p>MyTSA is a mobile application developed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to provide the traveling public access to relevant TSA travel information and supplement the TSA website. MyTSA enables individuals to search for the types of items that may be carried through TSA security checkpoints, read basic information regarding TSA checkpoint policies, search for TSA Pre✓®  lane hours of operation by airport, view and post crowdsourced wait times at TSA checkpoints, and view current travel conditions at the airports important to them. </p>

        <h2><i>Information Collected</i></h2>
            <p>MyTSA does not collect or use PII or SPII. Location information is collected if the user chooses to activate the devices Global Positioning System (GPS) to identify the closest airport., Once the application is downloaded, only non-sensitive information in the crowdsourced wait times feature is transmitted or shared with TSA. Use of the crowdsourced wait-times and “Can I Bring” features are voluntary, and no information about the user is transmitted back to TSA.</p>
        
        <h2><i>Uses of Information/Information Sharing</i></h2>
            <p>The contents contained within the mobile application are stored locally on the user’s device. Upon launching MyTSA for the first time, users may choose to use the device’s Global Positioning System (GPS) capability to identify the closest airport location, or simply input any airport they choose. Utilizing the GPS option allows MyTSA to automatically locate the device’s location upon application launch. The user’s location is detected by the device’s GPS function, but does not transmit its location to TSA. The “Ask TSA” feature in the mobile application contains links to TSA social media (Facebook Messenger, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram), contact information for TSA (website, contact center phone number/email, TSA Cares phone number), and links to the application tutorial, Terms of Service, Feeds and Credits, and Privacy Policy. It allows users to reach out to TSA through other applications and services if they have additional questions not found in MyTSA.</p> 
            
            <p>Two features that allow users to report information back to TSA are detailed below:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Crowdsourced wait times provide users the opportunity to help fellow travelers  by posting and viewing wait times for any airport. The wait time is self-reported by the user. The application will display the average of the last two hours’ worth of reported security wait times for each airport. Use of this feature is completely voluntary. No information about the user is collected or transmitted back to TSA.</li>
            <li>The “Can I Bring?” search enables individuals to query whether a particular item may be carried through the TSA security checkpoint, placed in checked baggage, or is prohibited. Individuals query the item to be brought through the checkpoint, and the feature displays the current TSA policy for the searched item. If an item does not exist in the search database, it may be submitted for consideration. This option allows the user to tap a button (labeled “Submit Item”), after which TSA receives an email from the TSA web service with the message content containing the suggested item. No information about the user is collected or transmitted back to TSA.</li>
            </ol>

         <h2><i>Application Security</i></h2>
            <p>With the exception of the crowdsourced wait times and “Can I Bring” item suggestion features, the contents contained within the mobile application are stored locally on the device. No information about the user is transmitted back to TSA.
            TSA will not collect PII from users of the MyTSA application. To further safeguard users of the MyTSA application TSA performs security analysis of each MyTSA application release before it is made available to the public.  In addition, Apple Inc. and Google perform independent security analyses of all applications made available via the respective public stores. </p>

        <h2><i>Analytics Tools</i></h2>
            <p>The iOS and Android mobile applications use Google Analytics to collect basic app usage information. Google Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information, but rather analyzes statistical information on number of sessions across devices, duration of sessions, and most frequently visited features. This information is used as feedback to TSA regarding user sentiment of MyTSA in order to further enhance the application to meet the needs of the traveling public.</p>
