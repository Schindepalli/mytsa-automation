      <h1>DISABILITIES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS</h1>

      <p>To ensure your security, all travelers are required to undergo screening at the checkpoint. You or your traveling companion may consult the TSA officer about the best way to relieve any concerns during the screening process. You may provide the officer with the TSA notification card</a> or other medical documentation to describe your condition. If you have other questions or concerns about traveling with a disability please contact.</p>
      
      <p>If you are approved to use TSA Pre✓® lane at a participating airport, you do not need to remove shoes, laptops, 3-1-1 liquids, belts, or light jackets during the screening process. You are required to undergo screening at the checkpoint by technology or a pat-down. Also, TSA officers may swab your hands, mobility aids, equipment and other external medical devices to test for explosives using explosives trace detection technology.</p>
      
      <p>You are not required to remove your shoes if you have disabilities and medical conditions. However, your shoes must undergo additional screening including visual/physical inspection as well as explosives trace detection testing of the footwear. You can request to be seated during this portion of the screening.</p>

                        <p>Passengers with intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, such as Down syndrome or autism, can be screened without being separated from their traveling companions if traveling with one. You or your traveling companion may consult the TSA officer about the best way to relieve any concerns during the screening process.

You may provide the officer with the TSA notification card or other medical documentation to describe your condition.</p>
                   <h3><strong>SCREENING</strong></h3>
                        <p>Submit the device for X-ray screening if you can safely disconnect. Consult with the manufacturer of the device to determine whether it can pass through the X-ray, metal detector or advanced imaging technology for screening.</p>
                        <p>If you cannot disconnect from the device, it may require additional screening and those in sensitive areas are subject to careful and gentle inspection.</p>

                   <h3><strong>SCREENING</strong></h3>
                        <p>Advanced imaging technology can facilitate your screening and reduces the likelihood of a pat-down. You should not be screened by a walk-through metal detector if you have an internal medical device such as a pacemaker. Consult with your physician prior to flying.</p>

            <div>
                  <p>Medications in pill or other solid form must undergo security screening.&nbsp;It is recommended that medication be clearly labeled to facilitate the screening process. Check with state laws regarding prescription medication labels.</p>
                  <p>You are responsible for displaying, handling, and repacking the medication&nbsp;when screening is required. Medication can undergo a visual or X-ray screening and may be tested for traces of explosives.</p>
                  
                  <h3><strong>INFORM THE TSA OFFICER</strong></h3>
                        <p>Inform the TSA officer that you have&nbsp;medically necessary liquids and/or medications and separate them from other belongings before screening begins.

                  <h3><strong>3-1-1 LIQUIDS RULE Exemption</strong></h3>
                        <p>You may bring medically necessary liquids, medications and creams in excess of 3.4 ounces or 100&nbsp;milliliters in your carry-on bag. Remove them from your carry-on bag to be screened separately from the rest of your belongings. You are not required to place your liquid medication in a plastic zip-top bag. If a liquid, gel, or aerosol declared as medically-necessary alarms, then it may require additional screening and may not be allowed</p>
                  <h3><strong>ACCESSORIES</strong></h3>
                        <p>Ice packs, freezer packs, gel packs, and other accessories may be presented at the screening checkpoint in a frozen or partially-frozen state. These items do not have to accompany medication or liquids to be considered medically necessary. All items, including supplies associated with medically necessary liquids such as IV bags, pumps, and syringes must be screened before they will be permitted into the secure area of the airport.</p>
                  <h3><strong>SCREENING</strong></h3>
                        <p>TSA officers may test liquids for explosives or concealed prohibited items. If officers are unable to use X-ray to clear these items, they may ask to open the container and&nbsp;transfer the liquid to a separate empty container or dispose of a small quantity of liquid, if feasible.</p>
                        <p>Inform the TSA officer if you do not want your liquid medication to be screened by X-ray or opened. Additional steps will be taken to clear the liquid and you will undergo additional screening procedures to include a pat-down and screening of other carry-on property.</p>

                        <p>Walkers, crutches, canes or other mobility aids and devices must undergo X-ray screening. A TSA officer will inspect the item if it cannot fit through the X-ray. Notify the TSA officer if you need to be immediately reunited with the device after it is screened by X-ray.</p>
                  <h3><strong>WHEELCHAIRS AND SCOOTERS</strong></h3>
                        <p>TSA officers will screen wheelchairs and scooters to include the seat cushions and any non-removable pouches or fanny packs. Items will be tested for traces of explosives, and removable items will undergo X-ray screening.</p>
